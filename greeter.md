## Greeter

From [this repository](https://github.com/wix/tdd-katas).

#### Before you start:
* **Try not to read ahead.**
* **Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.**

This kata demonstrates the problems of static scoped functions and objects.

All tests should always pass, regardless of environment conditions.

1. Write a `Greeter` class with `greet` function that receives a `name` as
   input and outputs `Hello <name>`. The signature of `greet` should not change
   throughout the kata. You are allowed to construct `Greeter` object as you
   please.
2. `greet` trims the input
3. `greet` capitalizes the first letter of the name
4. `greet` returns `Good morning <name>` when the time is 06:00-12:00
5. `greet` returns `Good evening <name>` when the time is 18:00-22:00
6. `greet` returns `Good night <name>` when the time is 22:00-06:00
7. `greet` logs into console each time it is called
