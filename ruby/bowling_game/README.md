## Scoring bowling

  1 4  |  4 5  |  6 ◪  |  5 ◪  |    ■  |  0 1  |  7 ◪  |  6 ◪  |    ■  |  2 ◪  6 
 :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------:

The game consists of 10 **frames** as shown above. In each frame the player has
two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for _strikes_ and _spares_.

A **spare** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus
for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. So in frame
3 above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)

A **strike** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The
bonus for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the
extra balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be
rolled in tenth frame.

## The requirements

Write a class named "Game" that has two methods:
* `roll(pins)` is called each time the player rolls a ball. The argument is the
  number of pins knocked down.
* `score()` is called only at the very end of the game. It returns the total
  score for that game.
